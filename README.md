A web-accessable IPMI / IP KVM system that provides full keyboard control, monitor
view, mount disk images, and and the ability to reboot computers with standard
motherboards remotely as if you were sitting in front of them with a keyboard and
monitor. Inspired by the project by [@Fmstrat](https://github.com/Fmstrat/diy-ipmi).

Adsisto is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/),
and is designed to have a small fingerprint and to run on single-board computers.
