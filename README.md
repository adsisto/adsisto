A web-accessable IPMI / IP KVM system that provides full keyboard control, monitor
view, and and the ability to reboot computers with standard motherboards remotely
as if you were sitting in front of them with a keyboard and monitor. Inspired by
the project by [@Fmstrat](https://github.com/Fmstrat/diy-ipmi).

Adsisto is written in Go and React, and is designed to have a small fingerprint
and to run on single-broad computers.
